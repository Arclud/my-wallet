My Wallet is a free and open source **money management android app**. It's written using **100% Kotlin and Jetpack Compose**. It's designed to help you keep track of your personal finances with ease.

Think of Ivy Wallet as a manual expense tracker that tries to replace the good old spreadsheet for managing your finances.

**Do you know? Ask yourself.**

1) How much money do I have in total?

2) How much did I spend this month and what did I spend it on?

3) How much can I spend and still meet my financial goals?

A money management app can help you answer these questions.

Ivy Wallet may lack some of the features you're looking for, but it truly shines in its user interface and experience, as well as its simplicity and customization options. This was recognized in the ["Top/Best Android App in 2021/2022 charts"](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLguJN0waG1-eSzKMuFMIULrR3MlqJ3cAE) by the YouTube tech community.
