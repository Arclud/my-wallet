My Wallet is a free and open source **money management android app**.(forked from [ivy-Wallet](https://github.com/Arclud/my-wallet) since it's no longer supported) It's written using **100% Kotlin and Jetpack Compose**. It's designed to help you keep track of your personal finances with ease.

Think of My Wallet as a manual expense tracker that tries to replace the good old spreadsheet for managing your finances.

**Do you know? Ask yourself.**

1) How much money do I have in total?

2) How much did I spend this month and what did I spend it on?

3) How much can I spend and still meet my financial goals?

A money management app can help you answer these questions.
